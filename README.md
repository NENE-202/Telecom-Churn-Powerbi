# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Why This Project Matters

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. Losing customers directly reduces revenue and increases the cost of acquiring new ones. Understanding why customers leave and identifying high-risk segments helps telecom companies design effective retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase lifetime value.

## Business Problem

The telecom company is experiencing customer loss but lacks clear visibility into the factors driving churn.
Key questions include:

* Which customers are most likely to churn?
* What services or behaviors increase churn risk?
* Does contract type or payment method affect retention?
* When in the customer lifecycle does churn occur most?

The goal is to analyze customer data to uncover churn patterns and provide actionable insights to support retention decisions.
